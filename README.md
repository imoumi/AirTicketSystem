# Flight Booking System

## The airport ticket booking system books flights to Calgary, Montr√©al, Toronto and Vancouver


- **What will the application do?**  
The application will be used in a small airport where tickets can only be booked at the airport terminal using booking 
machines. The airport operates flights only to Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary. The application takes in 
required information about the travel and presents the customer with options to choose from. Upon selection the customer
is asked to enter their personal information. When all the information is entered booking is confirmed, and a booking 
number is generated.

- **Who will use it?**  
The system is to be installed outside airports for the *customers* to conveniently book tickets on the 
spot using electronic payment methods.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**  
The project is of my interest because I am interested in booking systems and 
how companies like travel companies help book tickets to their customers so conveniently.



## **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to select my travel date.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my travel destination from options given.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my flights from a list of available flights.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter my personal details such as Name, date of birth, Phone number.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my seat on a flight from a list of available seats on the flight.

## Limitations for this Phase
- Flights are only available for select dates and that why the application is fully functional for those dates. If the
selected dates are not chosen, then the system responds with no flights available.
- As this is a console based program as of now there are not many flights added since it exceeds the 25 lines in the 
method. Therefore, only one flight per destination can be found.  
- All the flights to all the selected destinations are only available on 3rd, 15th and 24th of October 2020.
